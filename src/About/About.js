                <p>
                    For me Eye Site is about the future of media and how we are represented in it. As the streaming industry becomes oversaturated, everyone is trying to stand out (Ex. the short lived Quibi which only had 10 minute shows). Imagining a hyper-specific streaming service for only Eye-themed content doesn’t feel that far off. During the Covid pandemic, our faces are half covered in public life, identities are obscured, we don’t recognize our neighbors anymore. What if this concealing of identity progressed even further? Could we communicate and connect to each other with just an eye showing? A mouth? An ear?  
                    <br/>
                    And I also think about the ever growing presence of surveillance in personal technology--more eyes are on us than ever. With these isolated videos of eyeballs, Eye Site is a sort of panopticon. It can observe and identify us but we can’t know anything about it. While I think we should lean into the humor of this project (all the silly eye videos), I also think there could definitely be something sinister about it.

                    The isolation of my eye against a black background came from lacking a sense of self and not knowing how I fit into my surroundings as an artist. By surroundings, I mean my professional surroundings as a corporate employee, my urban surroundings and all of the racial and economic tensions it entails, and the art world with its market-based trends, theory, and political biases. So, the isolated eye darting around the dark space represents my own search for the political, moral, aesthetic values that I will ultimately subscribe to as I become an older, more established artist.

                    The website, then, might function as a collection of similar stories, about people’s individual journeys as they develop their own identities in relation to the incredibly complex and problematic society in which we live. A particular focus I’m interested in, in this regard, is political polarization, and the fact that the radical beliefs that are catching fire today are so radical that they are often contradictory to certain truths.

                    “I know it’s been a rough year for everyone, but I can’t help but notice that no one has checked in on me. To begin with, I’m never seen as an individual. Always a pair. But I’m my own eye. I have my own needs, my own dreams, my own life. Also, I’m always the one expected to be doing the seeing, but I can’t even remember the last time anyone saw me. Like, ACTUALLY saw me. And I was feeling all of this before 2020! This year my workload has been double. Mouth and nose aren’t allowed to be seen in public anymore. So I’ve been doing double duty in terms of seeing and expressing. People are relying on me for a smile instead of mouth, and I don’t even know if I’m doing a good job at it most of the time. It’s been rough. At home, my tear ducts are working over time, there is so much to cry about, I didn’t know I could produce so many tears but obviously I can and nothing about this year is giving me a break.

                    It would be really nice if I had a website I could go to that is just for ME. Where I can be not only seen, but heard! And felt. Maybe then I wouldn’t feel so alone.”
